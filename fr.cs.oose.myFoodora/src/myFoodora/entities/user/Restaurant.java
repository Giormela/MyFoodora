/**
 * Represents a restaurant in the system. This class extends LocalizedUser.
 *
 * The Restaurant class manages dishes and meals, including the creation, addition, and removal
 * of dishes from its menu. It also supports the creation and management of meals using a MealBuilder.
 * The class handles meal discounts, orders placed to the restaurant, and tracks meal and dish popularity by order frequency.
 *
 * Attributes:
 * - genericDiscountFactor (Double): The default discount rate applied to meals not designated as Meal of the Week.
 * - specialDiscountFactor (Double): An enhanced discount rate applied to the Meal of the Week.
 * - menu (Map<String, Dish>): A collection of dishes offered by the restaurant, indexed by dish name.
 * - meals (Map<String, Meal>): A collection of fully prepared meals available, indexed by meal name.
 * - unreadyMeals (Map<String, MealBuilder>): Active MealBuilders for meals that are currently being created but are not yet finalized.
 *
 * Methods include functionality to add and remove dishes, create and finalize meals, manage Meal of the Week
 * settings, and display detailed information about the restaurant's offerings and current status.
